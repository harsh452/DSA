a+b*d =  abd*+;
here priority of * is the highest therefore we solve bd 1st and put its operator backwards , then bd* becomes a operand,
therefore we then solve a+ bd* so it becomes abd*+;

(a+b)*c = ab+c*;
(x*y)-(z/p) =  xy*zp/-

now lets convert infix to postfix;
a+b*d =  +a*bd;
(a+b)*c = *+abc;
(x*y)-(z/p) =-*xy/zp;


**** vvvip******\
if u wanna convert a numeric character like '9' to int 9 then
'9' - '0' = 9;
Because ascii value of '0' = 48;
and ascii value of '9' = 57;
so 57-48 = 9;
