we will use combination of itreation and recursion methods of recursion to solve this problem.

node* reverse(node* &head,int key){
 
    
    node* prev = NULL;
    node* curr =head;
    int temp = key;
    node* temp1;
    while(curr != NULL && key != 0){
         temp1 = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp1;
        --key;
        
    }
    if(curr!=NULL){
        head->next = reverse(curr,temp);
    }
    return prev;
    
}
