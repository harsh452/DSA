maximum nodes at any level L  in binary tree => 2^L'
max no. of nodes in tree of height 2^h - 1;
A binary tree with L leaves nodes has atleast log(N+1) + 1 no. of levels;

struct node{
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
    node(int val){
        data = val;
        left = NULL;
        right = NULL;
    }
}

int main() {

    struct node* root = new node(1);
    root->left = new node(2);
    root->right =  new node(3);
    return 0;
}
