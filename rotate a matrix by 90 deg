So in this question we first need to calculate the transpose of the given matrix because after doing transpose all the rows will become columns.

*->  Transpose of the matrix 

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
 for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
    swap(arr[i][j],arr[j][i]);
  }
}

after calculating transpose all we need to do is just reverse every row of matrix.
 for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    reverse(arr[i].begin(),arr[i].end());
 }
